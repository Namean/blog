Today I worked mostly on Java, what I really mean is that I skipped around in the Udemy tutorial like I usually do. Section 13 Intro to the Spring Framework, 241. Terry Martin. Anyway he goes on about using Thymeleaf with Spring



### Spring & Tymeleaf

Spring is like express for Java but so much more, I think its middleware, or something like that

and Tymeleaf is a support making templates in HTML from Spring somehow I'm not really sure how it works yet.



From there I was curious if sessions was something that could be done in Spring which of course,

So I'm scanning through the Baeldung article and I come across something about Redis,

In the video while Terry is explaining how to load Tyhme leaf data into BootStap 5, theres a some output in his terminal about com.zaxxer.hikari.pool.HikariPool, so I'm wondering what that is.

https://www.baeldung.com/hikaricp

Hiraki is a JDBC connection pooling framework, that is very light weight at 130Kb (Kilo-bytes) developed by Brett Wooldrige around 2012

The framework is so fast because of the following techniques have been applied


Bytecode-level engineering - some extreme bytecode level engineering (including assembly level native coding) has been done.

Micro-optimizations - although barely measurable, these optimization combined boost the overall performance

Intelligen use of the Collections framework - The ArrayList<Statement> was replaced with a custom class, fastList, that eliminates range checking and performs removal scans from head to tail.

I'm not really sure what all that means but it sound really cool!


While I was looking up the Forth programming lanugage I saw a picture of the Haxxe logo, which I had mistaked for zig when watching a video from the ThePrimeagen. I remembe reading the descripion about Haxxe and rejecting it, but that's not what I thought about zig. Its super pedantic, but it looks interesteing also there are some companies that are suporting Zig,

like Oven, who is Oven? Just a small nobody company wrote something called Bun.js, you probably have never heard of it.

https://oven.sh/

Please meet Oven — the company that will lead Bun’s development, offer hosting, and grow Bun into an end-to-end solution for JavaScript.

Oven has raised $7m in funding led by Bucky at Kleiner Perkins with participation from Guillermo Rauch, YCombinator’s Continuity Fund and more.

As I'm going through Bun stuff, I'm like of "oh ye, deno is a thing". What's up with that?
