Today is Friday meaning that its almost the weekend W00T!

This week I want to work on typescript so that I can complete ThePrimeagen course on Algorithms



### TypeScript

A reader who completes the walkthrough should be able to:
- Read and understand commonly-used TypeScript syntax and patterns
- Explain the effects of important compiler options
- Correctly predict type system behavior in most cases


Each section aims to provide a deeper explanation of a single concept - meaning there is no aim for continuity.

#### TypeScript: The Basics



## Query: {testing typescript}

### Writing Unit Tests in TypeScript

[Writing Well-Structured Unit Tests in TypeScript](https://dev.to/arifintahu/writing-well-structured-unit-test-in-typescript-2hal)

This tutorial is a bit of a stretch for me, mainly because it uses, Sequelize, which is a library that uses Promises, and I'm still kinda unfamiliar with using them.


[Separate repository layer and service layer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5049363/difference-between-repository-and-service-layer)


### Testing TypeScript apps using Jest
[testing typescript apps using jest](https://blog.logrocket.com/testing-typescript-apps-using-jest/)

This tutorial also uses Sequilize



### Tutorail Recommender - Clarify App Component: Token extraction and tagging

What if I had a system that could recommend tutorials?
also what if you could search based on a fine grained criterion of needs.

Such as language, framework, features, concepts i.e unit testing, design patterns etc

It sounds pretty cool!

On websites that have really nice documentation, they'll have a little tab where the user can change which langauge or version or some parameter to suite their needs, 

Heres an example on [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=linux)

Which I think they are pulling data from the useragent that gets sent with each http request.









### The course
I was thinking today about building my own course, about what I think is important for developing software.
Things that I think are important and could help others avoid some pitfalls. I wanted the course to be something
that I would have wanted when I first started programming, and to an intermediate level.


I wanted it to cover design patterns, and data strucutres and algorithms. Butnow that I think about it that sounds
like a more advanced course. But I also wanted it to cover some of the more rudimentary parts of programming as well.
And I'd to make building software is not the same as writing code.

### The course(s)?

I'm thinking that it could cover more than one course, because I really don't want it to be massive.
