Today is Friday meaning that its almost the weekend W00T!

This week I want to work on typescript so that I can complete ThePrimeagen course on Algorithms



### TypeScript

A reader who completes the walkthrough should be able to:
- Read and understand commonly-used TypeScript syntax and patterns
- Explain the effects of important compiler options
- Correctly predict type system behavior in most cases


Each section aims to provide a deeper explanation of a single concept - meaning there is no aim for continuity.

#### TypeScript: The Basics






### The course
I was thinking today about building my own course, about what I think is important for developing software.
Things that I think are important and could help others avoid some pitfalls. I wanted the course to be something
that I would have wanted when I first started programming, and to an intermediate level.


I wanted it to cover design patterns, and data strucutres and algorithms. Butnow that I think about it that sounds
like a more advanced course. But I also wanted it to cover some of the more rudimentary parts of programming as well.
And I'd to make building software is not the same as writing code.

### The course(s)?

I'm thinking that it could cover more than one course, because I really don't want it to be massive.
