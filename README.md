a blog about me

I'm creating this blog as a central place to get my projects organized and make the best use of my time.


I want to learn from courses but also like doing small projects and trying things out, but also want to be able to challenge myself so that I can grow as a software developer.



Over the last six years I've picked up a few languages, mainly python and javascript. But I want to focus more on things that will get me hired as a professional developer. Like data strucutres and algorithms, and system design.

I've been going about this kind of at random, and I'm not too impressed with the results, given the amount of time I've been putting into my study and practice. However I'm looking to make a more concentrated effort towards getting hired as a developer some day!

Another one of the big things that has been stopping me is that I want things to be "perfect" rather than good enough to make them official or feel like something is "worth it". 

So I'm going to change my thinking and go about making small incremental improvements.
