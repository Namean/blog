## Theo - t3.gg

Theo is like the front-end to ThePrimeagen's backend, working on technologies like Typescript, Next.js and tRPC.

 I found his channel with this video [Performance Doesn't Matter...Until It Does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z4fZtSKlcE)

 Where he discusses how people may over optimize an application that doesn't necessarily need it, like kubernetes for a blog, or on the opposite, end of the spectrum, using Google sheets as a database.

## TypeScript
Last night I got a TypeScript, babel and jest to work together although there is still a warning that pops us from ts-jest

```
ts-jest[config] (WARN) message TS151001: If you have issues related to imports, you should consider setting `esModuleInterop` to `true` in your TypeScript configuration file (usually `tsconfig.json`). See https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2018/01/31/announcing-typescript-2-7/#easier-ecmascript-module-interoperability for more information.
```


### Github CLI

I've been wanting to create repositories in the terminal, which I'm not sure why its something that is recent or required a custom solution, anyway I'm hoping this will solve my problem so that I can work faster, and organize my coursework and projects with less friction than before.


## Vim language server


I've been wanting to add some plugins to vim, like a language server. I've done some basic things like changing the color scheme, and making some formatting changes with tabs and spaces. But I may be up for adding a plugin manager today, but if I can put it off I will


It turned out to be too much for me right now,
